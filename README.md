# ðŸ¤–ðŸ‘¾ Space Invaders ðŸ‘¾ðŸ¤–
This is an exercice we did on class to inprove our level with the objects, using the NuGet package Heirloom.

In the game, I made diferent game stages like the intro, personalization, game and the end with the scoreboard. 
- In the personalization, you can choose between 2 diferent ships (the dificulty changes between them because of it's diferent size) with 4 skins for each one (all made by me), by using the left and right arrow.
- After the personalization, you can put your name, so you'r score will be writed with your name (you can move on the string you write with arrows, and delete or add spaces or letters where you want. Only letters, spaces, arrows and backspace allowed).
- While playing, you can move the ship with the arrows, and shoot bullets (max 5 at the same time) against the aliens. If a bullet hits you, you lose 1hp, your ship will go on the center and all alien bullets will despawn (use it to buffer some situations and get the max amount of points!).
- The last part, when you lose, you will see the scoreboard with all the scores made on this run of the program (I didn't save the scores on a minidatabase, it all works meanwhile the program still running). There you can restart the game or exit and close it.

___Enjoy it ^^___
